# Another StwSim-PlugIn API (ASA)

This is another Java Libary to Communicate to a game of [Stellwersimulator](stellwerksim.de) via the PlugIn API. It can be used to create PlugIns for it. 
But whats spezial about this API? Its from me and therefore perfekt!

## Contents

Besides the SourceCode and some overhead this repo has two .jar files. One as a lib and the other as a tester. 
The lib has everthing you need to get startet with programming your PlugIn. The Tester on the otherhand additionally consists of a little Programm to test the api connection. You can also extend on it to see how everthing is working.
